# Privacy Policy for FanConnect

_Last updated: December 2025_

FanConnect by gento0 ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how the FanConnect mobile application ("the App") handles information when you use it. This policy meets the requirements of **Google Play** and the **Apple App Store**.

## 1. Information We Collect

FanConnect does **not collect, store, or share any personal data**.  
The App does not require user accounts, registration, or login.

Specifically, we do **not** collect:  
• Names  
• Email addresses  
• Phone numbers  
• Location data  
• Device identifiers  
• Contacts or media files  

## 2. Permissions Used

FanConnect only requests the minimum permissions required for core functionality:  
• **Flashlight / Camera (Flash)** — used exclusively to control the device flashlight during live music shows  
• **Internet access** — used to synchronize light effects in real time  

These permissions are used only while the App is active and are **not** used for tracking or marketing purposes.

## 3. How the App Works

FanConnect synchronizes flashlight behavior across multiple devices during live music shows. No personal or identifying data is transmitted or stored.

## 4. Data Sharing

FanConnect does **not share any personal user data** with third parties.  

The App may use **crash analytics services** (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics) to monitor app stability and detect crashes. These services collect only **technical data necessary to identify and fix app issues**, and **no personal or identifying information** is transmitted.  

The App does **not** use:  
• Advertising networks  
• Analytics for marketing purposes  
• Tracking SDKs for user behavior  

## 5. Data Retention

Because FanConnect does not collect personal data, **no data is stored or retained**.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

FanConnect does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App is suitable for general audiences.

## 7. Security

We take reasonable technical measures to ensure the App operates securely and reliably.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

Any changes will be posted on this page.
